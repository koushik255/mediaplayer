ok so basically the next video thing is not working properly because if you have no video folder in your que it will just crash
what i tried to do what to make it so that it would set the current video its playing as its default but thats not workigng either,
the best thing to probably to is to fix it, i also think its because in the next function im doing somehting

its because im setting th ecode smewhere its some bullshit but basically what i can do is 
if i make a closure so that the self.video_url is not updateing everytime this is called
wait i should just make it so that this next video_ does not do anything if a loaded_folder bool hasned been passed
ok thats fixed

now i need to fix how the panic work, if you click open file, or any of the opens and it doesnt return a file it panics,
it should be an easy fix since i just need to match the unwrap instead of expect

Ok i fixed it for the subtitles folder i just need to do the same thing for everything else,
also i can feel the preformance of the whole thing start fuckign up sometimes, it has to be because of the amount of clones made because its not like the video
is being refreshed over and over again,
