ok so basically the next video thing is not working properly because if you have no video folder in your que it will just crash
what i tried to do what to make it so that it would set the current video its playing as its default but thats not workigng either,
the best thing to probably to is to fix it, i also think its because in the next function im doing somehting

its because im setting th ecode smewhere its some bullshit but basically what i can do is 
if i make a closure so that the self.video_url is not updateing everytime this is called
wait i should just make it so that this next video_ does not do anything if a loaded_folder bool hasned been passed
ok thats fixed

now i need to fix how the panic work, if you click open file, or any of the opens and it doesnt return a file it panics,
it should be an easy fix since i just need to match the unwrap instead of expect

Ok i fixed it for the subtitles folder i just need to do the same thing for everything else,
also i can feel the preformance of the whole thing start fuckign up sometimes, it has to be because of the amount of clones made because its not like the video
is being refreshed over and over again, 

ok basically all the panics are done expect for the video folder, which i will do now

Should i "clean" the code up using functions?
its not like i need to load thing up from different places, anyways since its not panicing on errors its fine now 

ok the best way to handle the errors is via functions, this is kinda funny figureing something like this way later
but with the functions i can make sure that i never have to .unwrap() within a message so i can almost always handle it gracefully

ok opening a video folder makes it very laggy, lets check on realease, it works fine on realase so wtf

ok i shold look into whats causeing that and then i can look towards adding like picture thumbnails of the scroll bar
i can also make it conditionally render and i should probably move it aswell just because it kinda gets in the way of the subtitles maybe i could move it like up? 
hopefully it would let me do that without considering it in the space of the video player, also i should try to see if i can make it so the vidoe player is async
because i could just run that in a possition in a different view functoin or whatever like since it would be the only element everything else would just be working around that
