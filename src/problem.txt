ok so basically the next video thing is not working properly because if you have no video folder in your que it will just crash
what i tried to do what to make it so that it would set the current video its playing as its default but thats not workigng either,
the best thing to probably to is to fix it, i also think its because in the next function im doing somehting

its because im setting th ecode smewhere its some bullshit but basically what i can do is 
if i make a closure so that the self.video_url is not updateing everytime this is called
wait i should just make it so that this next video_ does not do anything if a loaded_folder bool hasned been passed
ok thats fixed
