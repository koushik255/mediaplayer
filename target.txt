-be able to control the streams of the video (ffmpeg)
- be able to control the subtitles / fix the renderer for customs (should just be able to extract the embedded subs tbh)
have the videos on the side of the screen and have it be somewhat of a dropdown menu where you can select which episode you want to watch
- i would need to remake it all tbh for it to work onto ffmpeg instaed
