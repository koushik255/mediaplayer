---DONE-be able to control the streams of the video (ffmpeg)
-DONE--- be able to control the subtitles / fix the renderer for customs (should just be able to extract the embedded subs tbh)
--DONE-- have the videos on the side of the screen and have it be somewhat of a dropdown menu where you can select which episode you want to watch
-NOPE- i would need to remake it all tbh for it to work onto ffmpeg instaed
-DONE--Move stuff into different files instead of everything just being inside the app.rs becayse its kinda unorginized atleast to me it is just
a little bit
--DONE---try zed??
--DONE--make the button normal because their are fucked rn
--DONE--trouble shoot everything to do with the screenshots because they are not 100% tbh right now and
--DONE--maybe just move alot of stuff to teh settings menu
---DONE---implement the "screenshot taken thing"
--DONE--i want like a video info button, where it would kinda pause the video and kinda like how the settings button is like semi transparent but this time
it just takes up the whole middle of the screen kinda and just lists what ffprobe would say about the video/the gstreamer equivilent
-DONE--- put a little thing above play button which shows you the current video playing
DONE--i also want to implement my file viewer thing, like instead of when you open a folder it




--- DIFFERENT MONITORS FUCKS EVERYTHING UP 
-- maybe you would want it so that instead of seeing any buttons its basically just all keybinds and popup menus
subs still fuckedZ":
-- need to get the current display resolution the iced window is on then the video resolution would just change depending on that 

--Ok, i think i need the setttings menu to be better first, then subtitles then fix the monitor situtaion
--also maybe just switch of iced because what im doing isnt excusive to it
--ai for finishing functions
maybe look at zig cause i needa get better at program tbh but
just so i can fully control everything?
ehh i dont need to thats just shiny object tax breh
lets just work backwards to make the video player aucalty good



--ISSUES--
 if there are no subtitles why is the subtitles little thing on the screen?/layer
why is the video not in the middle of the whole application, like the space between the left and the right of the edges are un even
why are the settings and video info button on the same vertical axis as the text, even when there is empty space below them, and why is the file button not in the same
container as the other visible buttons
-Subtitles thing is still fucked idk why



--Todo
add skip intros

--if i wanted to control the player from an external resource how would i do so? or how would i make it possible?
-- since iced ui is so so so dogshit i want to extrapolate all the ui, this would be possible becase of the message system which iced implements
what would i want to keep in the iced?
volume, audio + subtitles track control (not the movement )

--want to make it so that the subtitles are line 100% correct always, but how would i implement a system for that?

--so today i want ot work on subtitle working 100% and then also abstarcting the control system ui away from iced and almost leaving just a blank player like mpv almost





--mono ep 10




-- implement a clipping system?
the clipping system would just create a new gstreamer pipeline then take the time you started at then just clip that
-- somehow track the time of videos you watched?
-- that could probably be via database like it could just hold the time of each video that you exit
--add keybinds---
